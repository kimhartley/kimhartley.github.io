      <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is the creation and strengthening of neural (brain) pathways. It will benefit people if they have an understanding on how the mind works. 
        They will be most likely be able to change there mindset from fixed to growth. They will realise that actually practice makes perfect, that learning and using 
        there knowledge will make there brain pathways stronger. So by repititive work they can learn new things and make what they have learnt permanent.
        <br>For me it's not how I might engage with neuroplasticity, but more so how I am! I'm learning all very new subjects (I do have small parts of knowledge in IT) and 
        I assume i've got new pathways being built. When learning I try and take something new in and then I will redo what i've learnt or look into it more to add to my 
        learning. For instance, this is the third or fourth time that i've gone over what neuroplasticity is during this course
        <br>.The ways you can increase neuroplasticity is by repitition! So for this exercise and course in regards to this subject i've learnt and read over neuroplasticity 
        before the orientation, after the orientation and now in sprint 4. I've also done some googling and reading on the matter. Now if the word is said or I had to talk about 
        the subject I can talk about it reasonably well without looking any info up...
        
        <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
        Growth mindset is where a person thinks they are able to learn. Fixed is where they think they can't. So a fixed person would look at a subject like programming
        and think there is no way that they would be able to understand it or even learn it so what is the point! A growth mindset differs in where a new topic is a 
        potential subject to learn and not really an obstacle. It's something they are open to trying and want to learn. Fixed is closed to learning it as they think they can't. 
        It's relevant in the way that people should want to grow. They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, so why would you want to be like that?
        <br>In my own exploration of the topic I haven't been surprised by anything. I guess over the last years i've been trying to change in various ways. That ranges from learning 
        new things, be open to new people and situations. I'm slowly but surely i'm changing. Haha I mean i've left the comfort and security of a full time job to learn a new thing and open up my future.
        <br>As far as integrating the growth mindset into my life, i'll just be more active with what i've been/what i'm doing. I won't look at thing in the way of I can't do this, 
        I don't want to do thing or this is boring (not that it has been or is). I'll learn and keep learning whatever I can. I'll never think this is pointless and i've done this before or I already know this so what's the point.
