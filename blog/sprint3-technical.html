      <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>One analogy of the differences between the two is by thinking of a house. HTML code is the how you structure and fill your website out. So the structure of the house is the HTML. 
        When you think about your house and what it is comprised of to make it your house. My house has 4 bedrooms, 1 office, a kitchen, a lounge and 2 bathrooms. 
        If you build a house, you start from the ground up. To simplify things and not go to into detail with things like windows, piping and cables etc. You would build the foundations, 
        build the frame of the house (obviously planned out where the rooms and sizes are) and then finish up the walls, roof etc. 
        <br>HTML is very similar, except you'd start from top to bottom. You'd make the foundations of the page (the most basic would have HTML, body, heading and a paragraph code),
        you would other code in to build it like a houses framework and then fill the page with the content you want to put (like finishing up the house).
        <br>We can also us the analogy of the house to think of and explain CSS. CSS is where you write the styling (like colors or positioning of objects) for the website.
        So imagine your bedroom and think about where you've put your bed, shelves, drawers and so on. When you moved in and before you set up your room, it would for instance be a big pile of your stuff.
        From that pile you'd sort everything out and set it up the way you want. With a website without CSS would have no color, no font styling and no positioning 
        (all font and objects would be on the left side). Like you set up your room, you use the CSS to sort of the contents of the page. You position where you want pictures or content to go, add color or new fonts to 
        the writing until everything looks good, sorted out and not bland.
        <br> 
        <h3>Control flow and looping</h3>
        Control flow is the order in which statements, instructions and functions are executed and evaluated. Loops are where the program will perform a set of instructions until
        a condition has been met. For example you could think about practicing basketball and say you want to work on your 3 point shot from a certain position on the court. You would take your
        position where you want to shoot from, you'd make the shot, see if it went in and then go to get the ball to do it again. So the flow would be, position, shoot and retrieve. You
        had decided before going that you'd make a hundred shots before you left. So you would shoot a hundred shots and then you could stop (ending the loop). 
        <br>
        <h3>DOM</h3>
        The DOM is Document Object Model. It is a data representation of the objects on a page and it looks like a family tree would. Your family tree say starts at your parents, then its you and your siblings
        and if then their children. The DOM would start at the top with HTML (parents) then it would show the elements, like the head or body of the page (siblings) and then the elements underneath like paragraphs (children).
        You can see the DOM on your browser, for example in chrome if you right click, click inspect then you can see and manipulate the DOM. You can also manipulate it from the code editor. 
        From here you write in code to do whatever you are wanting to do. For instance, this sprint we used code to change the appearance of 4 dots written into the HTML code. We were able to reveal a hidden dot and change the colors.
        <br>
        <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
        An array is a type of a list, a special variable which can hold multiple values. For example the variable is cars and values would be types like BMW or Audi. So it'd look something like 
        cars = ['BMW', 'AUDI', 'TOYOTA']. These can be accessed by an index number, with programming the value always starts at 0. So BMW would be [0], AUDI [1] and TOYOTA [2]. 
        <br>Objects represent "things" which has properties. So for an objecy you also use cars and the properties would be of the car. It'd look something like cars = {type: 'BMW', made: 2020, color: 'Black'} and you can access it
        like an array (index number) but with a key. For example you'd write car.color (to return black) or car['make'] (to return 2020).
        <br>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        A function simply put is a block of code which performs a particular task. This is useful as it allows a website to be able to do things from interactions. For example you have a calculator,
        you would write in the functions so it would operate correctly. Say you inputed 1*9 and hit =, the function would allow it to be proccessed and would return the answer of 9.
