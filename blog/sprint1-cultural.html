      <p>Probably my most core and driving value is - my friends are my world. That's not to disparage my family. Things have definitely changed and my relationship are
          on par with friends importance wise. I'm very loyal and would do whatever I could for my friends.
          <br>With that said, I guess the situation comes to mind is Christmas every year. Obviously Christmas is the time for family. Every year I will
          go up to see my family and spend time with them. I make the decision every year to leave in the afternoon to see my best friend and his mum.
          A few years ago, I hadn't really explained to my family why I wanted to leave and this made my family sad. I do value my family. With this
          I had to decide whether I left in the afternoon to see my friend or not. 
          <br>I had to weigh up the feelings and needs of both groups. Each group wanted to
          see me and spend time with me. I knew my family would be sad and dissapointed that I wanted to leave. It wasn't the fact I didn't want to spend time with them.
          Another factor which weighed in was that my sisters had partners, so they would leave and my parents wanted to nap or read. So interaction wasn't high.
          My best friend lives in Auckland now and I rarely see him, but I always know he will be here for christmas.
          <br>I had alot to weigh up with this call. There was the emotions of mine, my families and my best friend, the consequences of my actions and how it would affect everyone. 
          I guess the final thing in this situation was to weigh up what people would be doing at the time and how to use my time.
          In the end I chose to go see my best friend and his mum. The consequences of my choice, was that my family was dissapointed. They were sad and thought that I was
          avoiding them and that I didn't want to spend time with them. That wasn't the case, not easily explained, but I could've explained to help my family understand.
          <br>I don't really understand how i'm supposed to tie in my culture to this value and my identity after that decision...
          <br><br>
          I'm adopted from South Korea to an English family. I moved to Australia, when I was 6 months old and moved to New Zealand when I was nearly 10.
          I don't think my adoption has played into my values to much. But the move from Australia to New Zealand was hard for me. I got alot of shit from the boys
          at school. I think this truly shaped me the most. I had a few friends, but I still got into altercations with them from time to time. So when I truly 
          became friends with them and more, then the relationship and time was valued. Things had turned around, so that's where I got my core value from.
          As far as identity it also shaped me to a degree. My friends shaped me to, with there interests or what we did. Also doing what I liked as hobbies has shaped
          me as well. I think the most recent identity addition was when I became a DJ. Taking on a persona and becoming a performer has helped me to become who I am.
          This ranges from trying to be more confident when talking to people, what I wear, how I talk, act and so on.
          <br><br>
          When it comes to work my strengths are working hard, self determination and self motivation. These kind of all tie in or so I think.
          I work very hard to whatever is needed to get the job done. I do this as quickly and efficiently as possible. I worked for the most part alone at my old job,
          so I lacked help. If I didn't get it done, then there was a chance it wouldn't entirely even be done. I do care for others, so by me working hard I could make
          there lives easier.
          <br>I'm limited learning wise by my lack of prior knowledge, but according to EDA that's not the case.
          Limitations wise for career, my main limitation is my lack of interviewing skills and experience. That's in getting the job, there's also my lack of experience
          in the sector (seemingly you need to 2-3 years). In a career I'd say if I think I know what is best then I'm not the most open to change (so once i've got a job, but i've been working on that). 
          <br><br>
          I guess the strengths which will help are hard work, self determination to do whatever is needed, self motivation to do it quickly and efficently.
          This will and has already helped my learning so far in this course. I have worked hard to do the work and tried to retain as much information as possible.
          I've come across some obstacles already. I found I couldn't grasp what was presented. Instead of leave it or not make much of an effort, I have stopped what I was doing till I could understand it.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately in this case, the situation couldn't be worked out and if I did it again the outcome would be the same. As my role of head chef, I had to work along side
          my boss and bar manager. They would come to me about functions, menu requests or general tasks. Most of the time they were reasonable and doable.
          In extreme cases where I didn't think they were reasonable I would try to work something out.
          <br>I would listen to the request. For instance they wanted five new burgers ASAP for the menu, what went through the menu was thoughts of wastage and the 
          amount unneccessary. It was alot more work on top of my almost unmanageable tasks. I thought about ideas of what I could do and then went back to the manager.
          I laid out my thoughts on wastage, the extra work (having the items on hand and prepped) required and I thought we could cut the number back.
          <br>The manager wouldn't listen, reason or negotiate on any level. His word was final in this matter and I had to do what was told.
