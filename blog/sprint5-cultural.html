            <h3>Core learnings</h3>
            I've learnt over foundations about myself- 
            <ul>
                <li>Some topics from core to technical, I grasp alot easier and quicker than others. I learnt to use Git Bash easily as opposed to Javascript. Some things take way more work
                  and more research. Sprint 4 and 5 took alot of research for me to progress in small steps.</li>
                <li>I've learnt an order of what I should do if I have problems with learning. I'll try my knowledge, then google, ask my peers, google again and then if i'm really lost i'd ask
                  a teacher. Even if I do get it, i'll have a further look to see what else I can learn.</li>
                <li>My ego needs to come into play a bit more and I need to be confident with what i've learnt and what i'm doing. For example, sometimes i'm right and when it doesn't work I start to doubt myself.
                  In this instance the learning material program wasn't working or I just needed to take a bigger step to get it to work (rather than the small steps).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The roles of self awareness, empathy and values when it comes to learning and programming are important in varying ways. 
                Being self aware can be helpful in so many ways! First and foremost if you are aware of yourself and how (e.g pace or what works) you learn
                then you will most likely know what works or where you need to apply extra work. For instance over these 5 weeks, i've learnt if i'm struggling and not
                taking in the material to whatever the reason, then taking a quick break (cigi) or trying the next exercise is a better use of my time. I could keep
                on working but I would most likely forget what I had done. Also if I know something isn't working at all for me then i'll need to try something else like talking to someone.
                <br>Which kind of leads into empathy, having empathy for others and yourself is super helpful. If you can be understanding of and be able to share your feelings (empathetic)
                to others then you can work together and help each other. For example, i've helped some of my peers on this course to understand and to help what they are doing.
                From me helping them I got an even better understanding of what I have learnt. If I had lacked empathy then I would have possibly dealt with my peers in what
                would come across as rude and not been helpful (like I just did the work and not told them what i'd done).
                <br> This is the hardest one for me to explain and this is my understanding... Everyone values different things and everyone brings something to the table.
                So working either with or along side others then a persons values will be brought into the mix. I'd bring the value of hard work to the table and I might be lacking
                in another value or maybe i'd put one at a lower priority for example having fun whilst working. I could learn my coworkers (higher prioritised) values and possibly combine with
                mine, so i'd be a hard worker who is also having fun! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn't overly surprised by anything we learnt core skills wise. I'd come across the topics talked about via friends or just my own research. I was interested to hear 
                about emotional intelligence and neuroplasticity some more though!
            </p>
            <p>
                By far the most challenging core learning part was the listening and looping exercise. In this we took turns to talk for 2 minutes as the other listened.
                My struggle wasn't due to having to listen as I have no problem doing so. It was mainly just the fact that it should be done in absolute silence. We were told to nod 
                and not even make noises of confirmation. I like to at least say yup or hmm to show i'm listening.
            </p>
            <p>
                EDA has a large focus on core learning due to fact that people require and quite possibly lack people skills. Technical skills are important, but EDA teaches that
                having the people skills to interact with others in the workplace is just as important, if not more than having the technical skills. They say with/in businesses these days,
                that a person having good core skills with maybe average technical skills are hired over a person with minimal core skills and great technical skills. I'm unsure of what other courses
                teach people skills, but i'd say they would have far less focus on core skills and the majority would be technical skills.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning these core skills has been great. Even if I knew some of them already, it was good to go over them again and put them into context with doing them with programming.
                It was also good to have a mix of doing core and technical as if I was struggling with the technical, then I could take a break from it and do core skills learning. So I wasn't  
                distracted from learning, so my break would be another learning subject. I think just doing programming all the time would have possibly been slightly demoralising
                at times if I wasn't able to make progress or get what I was trying to do.

            <h3>Beyond</h3>
            <p>
                My long term goal is having a successful career in IT. I want to start by getting my foot in the door of the sector and then I hope to start building my experience and knowledge even more.
                I'm not entirely sure where I can go (career wise) after completing this course, as in I don't know what are behind the doors, but that the doors are there.
                I'd love to sharpen and build on my skills learnt from the course and to be able to bring my creativity or twist to the table. Haha i'm not saying that I want to change the game,
                but I want to be prideful of my work. I don't have a destination in mind, but I know there are so many oppurtunities and up is always good! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bootcamp will be a big test to see what I have learnt from the core learning and the technical skills. 
                <br>I think i'll be limited by knowledge and understanding of some of the technical aspects like Javascript. I think I lack a good understanding so I will be working on it this week 
                and next before bootcamp begins. After looking at what's lined up for bootcamp, then i'd be limited by my confidence when it comes to the presentational aspect. I dislike public speaking 
                and I don't think i'm great at it. The last thing which i'm not sure is a weakness but i'd like to see how being at EDA from 830am to 530pm every day will be like. I'm not sure if things
                like tiredness will hinder me. 
                <br>My strengths will be hard work, self motivation, working with others and perserverence. When it comes to work (not that this is work) then I work hard and perservere to do whatever is 
                needed to be done to complete the work. I worked alone the majority of the time so I was always good at motivating myself to do the work. When I did work with others,
                then I thought I was good at it. I'd have a good understanding of where their skills lied and what they would be the best at doing. So i'd get them to do that and try to compliment there work
                by doing what I did best.
                <br>My strengths and limitations haven't changed at all and I don't think i've discovered anything new or that I perceive them differently. It'll possibly be a hindrance to others if I don't have the 
                knowledge to help out or if they spend their time helping me. My strengths will help make up for it though...
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge by far will be the public speaking when doing presentations. I don't enjoy public speaking and lack confidence when it comes to that. I actually haven't done any in quite a long
                time and i'm not sure if things have changed since then. None the less it will be interesting. I don't think i'll have problems with staying focused during bootcamp or staying on top of material. I have 
                so much freedom these days, that it is amazing and everything i'm learning (even if it's frustrating or challenging) is great! 
            </p>
            <p>
                During bootcamp at EDA I have quite a few non technical skills i'd like to work on. I'd like to work on my confidence when it comes to speaking, whether it be in groups or doing a presentation and I hope to
                get more comfortable in doing so. This ties into communication, I'm working on my general communication and to be understandable to others. Sometimes I assume I make sense or people understand what i'm saying, so I'm
                working on that currently. I'm very eager to learn from the careers week and see where I can improve in regards to interviewing and the other areas around getting employed. I haven't done many interviews and 
                have only really worked in the hospitality sector. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With bootcamp, I will be for sure struggling with Javascript and I will be asking for help. With group work, i'll be asking my peers if I don't get it and if we can't as a group, then there is the teachers or other
                groups around. I don't want to be to much of a hindrance or interruptive, so based on the situation, I will ask whom I think suitable or maybe it will be something I can look into after work for the day has finished.
                For example, I might slightly grasp a concept and then to further understand I'll do research at night. 
                <br>To make sure I'm in the best state I can be, i'll be making sure I take a break if needed, eat and drink properly and get rest if needed. I'll also make sure I ask for feedback of what I can do better and if i'm given it
                then I will work on what was told to me.
            </p>
