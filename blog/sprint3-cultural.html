      <h3>Emotional Quotient (EQ)</h3>
        <p>EQ, emotional quotient or intelligence (EI) is having the ability to read ones own emotions and others. The person is self-aware and able to recognise the feelings one and others can have. 
        <br>This also includes the actions of yours, other peoples actions and how they affect a situation. They are able to use the information of the emotions/actions of theirs or others and use it to adjust to the situation.
        This adjustment can be done by making or changing the situation based on the emotions of either party. For example - easier by being empathetic (sharing and understanding feelings) with the other.
        <br>
        <h3>Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</h3>
        IQ, intelligence quotient is having the ability in which a person can learn and reason information. The person can use the knowledge that they learnt to solve problems. So a person with a higher IQ most likely has learnt and retained (not neccessarily)
        the knowledge required to solve the problem. On a more personal level i'd look at IQ not in the way of so much solving problems, but having a vaster knowledge on a specific topic or various topics. 
        <br>A persons IQ level can be worked out via IQ tests. Changes have been made over the past to these tests, but the data is taken from the persons knowledge to solve the problems in the given test. If the person can solve the problems,
        then person has a higher IQ.
        <br>
        <h3>The difference between them</h3>
        The variance in IQ and EQ is just the measures of what is being proccessed, both have the ability to learn and use information, then using it to help solve something. EQ being emotional information. 
        IQ is just general information. Both can be used to solve "problems". If a person is angry in a work situation due to a problem, then EQ can be used to work the situation with the person and IQ would be used to solve the actual work problem. 
        I'd even say the two go hand in hand. They can be used together to work things out dependent on the situation. In the case of the angry co worker, a person with both EQ and IQ could solve the problem, calm the person and even maybe make them happy.
        <br>
        <h3>The importance</h3>
        It's important to have both to a degree, one doesn't have to be super high in both. To have a good EQ is to be able to be a good person to others and to know how to act with them. They are self aware and can be empathetic.
        This has been explained to be very good for working with others in a job. No one wants to work with someone who is hard to get along with as it's less enjoyable.
        IQ is possibly not as important as EQ in a job, obviously dependent on what it is. Maybe your job is working alone and you don't need people skills. But if you want friends with good relationships then
        you'd want to have some EQ. But IQ for the job is to learn and the gain the knowledge required to do the job. They say the most successful people have a high EQ and good at working with others.
        Haha i'd even throw Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg in the mix. Both had a high IQ, very smart men, but I think they lacked EQ to treat the others well and focused
        on the task at hand, the goal to get what was done with little to no care of the co workers.</p>
