      <h2>Classes vs. ids! What are they? What are they best practices?</h2>
        
      <h3>Classes</h3>

      <p>Classes are an attribute which can specify one or more names (of the class) of a HTML element. 
        <br>Look at it like an actual class at school. Each class at school has a name and it is easier to group them together with a name.
        <br>For example - Class 1A. Class 1A has 30 different and individual student's. Obviously each student has their own name, 
        but to get the groups attention it would be easier for the teacher to say "Good morning 1A" as whole group, rather than greet them individually.
        <br>This is how the classes attribute looks like in HTML. As you can see below the classes are named- Country. In the class,
        the individual country name is listed after.So in HTML a page can have elements with multiple classes.
        <br>
        <br><img src="pictures/classes.jpg" alt="classes" style="width:90%">          
      </p>
      
      <h3>Ids</h3>  

      <p>Ids are an attribute which specifies a unique name of a HTML element.
        <br>Ids are just like your own identity. It's unique and specific to you. 
        <br>For example - My identity is Kim Hartley. As far as I know i'm the one and only one with that name.
        <br>This is how the id attribute looks like in HTML. As you can see below the id names are "unique" and different. So in HTML
        each page should only have one element with that one id.
        <br>
        <br><img src="pictures/ids.jpg" alt="classes" style="width:90%">
      </p>

      <h3>Classes vs. ids</h3>

      <p>The reasons the classes and ids are used are for styling. HTML uses a CSS file (Cascading Style Sheet) to give the page styling.
        So say the HTML is you and the CSS is an actual professional stylist. 
        <br>Imagine you have a photo shoot or an appearance in a movie, most likely you would want to look good and the best you can for 
        the world. So in this case you could hire a stylist or one might be provided. The stylist would work to make you look "better". 
        <br>The outfit is like the class, various pieces (shoes, top and pants etc) but it's still called an outfit as a whole. So you could refer to the
        stylist about sorting an outfit. In this case getting a haircut is the id, a single and specified task. So you'd tell the stylist you need a haircut.
        <br>In HTML code the CSS file uses the classes and ids on the elements to identify and style. For example look at the classes images provided earlier,
        the CSS file will have a styling which is identified by the class "country". Styling can be anything from changing the font, size, color or the positioning.
        For example. The CSS will note the element classes named "country" and change the styling on the browser.
      </p>

      <h3>The best practices</h3>
      <li>Try and keep the classes and ids to a minumum, there's alot of other functions one can use.</li>
      <li>Make ids unique and reuse classes as much as you need.</li>
      <li>Make the names descriptive as possible, it's a good way to help structure the site.</li>
      <li>The shorter the names the better, but they should be as long as you need.</li>
