        <h3>Problems</h3>
            <p>For this sprint we were doing some exercises which involved writing code to make some tests work. The tests had been pre set and the code was empty. So when we ran the program to see what would happen,
            alot of error messages came back and the test failed. We followed instructions to start inputting code and pass the tests. We were able to look at what the tests were for some further help.
            I got very stuck at one point with one of the exercises. I had been entering small amounts of code to try and pass the next test. But the test kept failing and I couldn't move to the next test.
            This really frustrated me as I doubted my knowledge and understanding of what I had learnt. I googled to try and make my understanding better and I was still stuck after googling and trying something new.
            So I moved onto the next exercise, finished that and then went back. After spending even more time on it, I asked one of my peers for help and still couldn't figure it out. Finally I reflected on what 
            I had done to try and figure out things. The problem had been I needed to look at a bigger picture, rather than just the small steps. So once I figured that out I put in more code and it passed.</p>
            
        <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudocode is like step by step instructions for a recipe. It doesn't have to be overly specific, it's more like one of those instagram videos
                    of people cooking where they show you what's added in steps but not how much. It's an outline of your code for humans and not a machine.
                    It's a commentary for yourself or other coders to know where and what you're doing.</li>
                <li>Trying something else or new is very helpful. When you're stuck on something you can take a quick break and go back to it. Being refreshed you might
                    look at it differently from what you were thinking of previously and be able to move on. Or trying a new way which you can find after maybe talking to someone
                    else or googling, can also achieve a new and possibly better understanding of what you're doing.</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky method is where a person would talk to an object (like a rubber ducky or a plant) and explain the step by step process or what they are doing.
                    Sometimes just saying it out loud as opposed to in your head will help you see things differently. By explaining it may bring up something unnoticed that you have missed.</li>
                <li>Reading error messages is a simple task and can be direct. If you are stuck, you can generally get an idea of what's wrong by looking at what the error is showing. 
                    The error usually shows exactly where it originates from and what is not understood. It might be an off or misplaced character. 
                    Even if you don't understand what has come back, then you can google the message and something usually can be found.</li>
                <li>Console logging is also simple. My understanding of them isn't the greatest i'd say. They are used to print variables, you put an input in and they show an output. 
                    So if you want to see what an array is showing you could type console.log(arr) and you'll see what is being put out. </li>
                <li>Googling is very informative in general. They say if you don't know something then google it. Whatever you google there is bound to be something helpful. I've had troubles with errors,
                    definitions of words or even just examples of how something is used. Even if I get something I can google it to do more research and get an even better understanding.</li>
                <li>Asking peers is a great thing to do and you can learn alot. Even if you aren't stuck on something, you can get a different perspective as everyone thinks and processes things differently.
                    Much like the rubber ducky method, helpful in the same way but you can actually get feedback this way.</li>
                <li>Asking coaches should be more helpful than asking a peer. One would assume they have the answer and they can explain things better than a peer. The "coach" would have
                    been doing this alot longer than most and so their knowledge should be more vast...</li>
                <li>Improving my process with reflection so far has been good! By reflecting i'll stop, take a step back and think. I'll think about what I have done and learnt, by this process I 
                    have found that other thoughts pop into my head of how I could've done something or how I had changed and adjusted what I was doing. Maybe something will come up I hadn't fully understood and
                    so i'll go look it up.</li>
            </ul>
