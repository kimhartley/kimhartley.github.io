      <p>My long term goals aren't something I generally think about much. My short term goals, were to leave the hospo sector and start this web dev course.
          Now i've achieved that, in the long term I would really like to take the career path of web dev and see where it leads me! So hopefully in 5-10 years,
          I would have been working and doing web dev, I would love to own a property and have a partner.
          <br>During my time at EDA the non technical skills i'd like to work on are growing my confidence with talking to strangers and/or people
          as i'm still shy and lack confidence at times. I'm also very interested in learning about what they have to teach about people skills and interviweing.
          I think interacting with new people in a group and doing public speaking will be good for me.
          <br>My think my strengths are loyalty, hard work, self determination and motivation. As far as limitations I think the main one would be I'm a creature of
          comfort and i'm not always open to trying new things if I feel uncomfortable with it. When I say try new things or being uncomfortable with, it usually
          is in reference to situations. I used to be limited energy wise due to work. But these days I feel less tired (well a different kind of tired) and I have far more freedom than I did. 
          <br>Alot of the things I have done for the last 2 weeks have been new and alot of changes have been made. I eat three meals a day, I wake up at 7am,
          I don't have work stress and I'm very happy about everything. I'm not scared, bored by learning or unmotivated to do anything on this course.Even yoga ha!
          My happiness, freedom and willing to learn is driving me to do my best and with the hope of a better future in mind, I don't think anything will interfere!
          <br>I'm committed to doing this course the best I can and to learn as much as I can. If I need help, I would google a solution if I thought I could, if working
          in a pair or a group, I'd ask the fellow students. If all else fails I would ask the teachers to help explain. This would all happen ASAP.
          <br>I don't really have any expectations of what I expect from the team. I expect they will teach the right stuff and help if needed.
          <br>Scheduling wise I have no conflicts at all. I'm trying to see a counsellor when I can, but no troubles at the moment. I'm here and ready to learn!</p>
